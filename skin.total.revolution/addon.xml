    <summary>A mod on the original Confluence by Jezz_X</summary>
    <description>Total Revolution is a skin designed for absolute ease of use and to serve as a base for community development. Full integration is the key, with some features never seen integrated into a skin before - this also has the ability to integrate android apps into XBMC/Kodi. Whilst this was originally designed with Android in mind it has grown and is fully functional on all other platforms and whilst making a fully customisable skin we aim to keep it as low on resources as possible.</description>
